# Machine_Learning

Here We are going to store all the projects that we will build with the leadership of [Cristian Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgarciae/)<br>

This team is composed by:

- Paulo Morillo [GitHub](https://github.com/PauloMorillo) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulo-morillo-mu%C3%B1oz-191745143/)

The Idea of this Repository is to use new top technologies applied in machine learning to improve everytime our knowledge about this amazing area.

## Here We have projects like:

- <b>Titanic</b>: This project consists in create a Machine Learning Model and deploy it on a server, in order to the users can consume the API where the model is. The idea of the API is to send all the information about a person that traveled or want to travel in the Titanic and return if the person survived or died. We will use some technologies here like (Typer, FastAPI, sklearn, pipelines to create the models, pandas, Mlflow, AWS, yaml files to set env values, docker compose, uvicorn)
