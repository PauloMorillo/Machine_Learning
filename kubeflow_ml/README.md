# Kubeflow

The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Our goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures. Anywhere you are running Kubernetes, you should be able to run Kubeflow.

## STEPS TO INSTALL IT
you can follow the next steps in your local machine but you have to have in it at least 16GB of RAM if you dont have it try using Google Cloud Platform.<br>
In this case we are going to create a Virtual Machine in GCP, where we are going to install kubeflow there.
